# Basics
## Animation of a protein and its binding pocket


In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of PyMOL animations.
We will use a protein-ligand complex of Cathepsin K and an inhibitor as an example.

The different python scripts run independent, but build up upon each other.
If you have no experience with PyMOL animations, start with part 1, otherwise you can also skip a few parts.

All scripts in this tutorial should be run using Python, not PyMOL.
